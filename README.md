## Description

This project proposal consists in developing a web app in which you log in to your account and can view, edit, delete and create the navers.

This application structure is based on [Atomic Design](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) using [React.V13.1](http://reactjs.org/).

This structure takes into account scalability and maintainability. The frameworks and tools which were used allow it to be improved and optimized maintaining an organized and reusable code.

```

Then go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
